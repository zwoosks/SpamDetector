# ANTISPAM PERMISSIONS:
# antispam.unban
# antispam.lookup
# antispam.bypass.ban.(see below)
#     bypass.x options: anvil, book, chat, sign, command, booktitle (if do you want to give all node perms, you'll only have to give "antispam.bypass.ban.*"
# antispam.bypass.alert.(see below)
#     the same as antispam.bypass.ban
# antispam.notify.banned.(See below)
#     banned.x options: anvil, book, chat, sign, booktitle, command (if do you want to give all node perms, you'll only have to give "antispam.notify.banned.*"
# antispam.notify.alert.(see below)
#     the same as antispam.notify.banned

# VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION:
# This plugin will only consider albhabetic chars (abcde... ñ, ç, etc) and numbers (spaces not included)
# Due to this, please, if for example you want to block serv.nu word, you'll have to block servnu
# If you want to block for example çpço block coco and the same for the other non-English chars (ñaña = nana, íe = ie, etc)
# By this way, people won't bypass the antispam replacing dots by other chars
